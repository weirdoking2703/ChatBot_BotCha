I named by ChatBot as BotCha
I didn't face any issues while creating this ChatBot, it was quite fun.
I forwarded the code to my friends(*not part of the internship), they were quite happy and got to feed questions and answers that they wish to.
The only thing I wanted to do was to create a GUI, but I need to learn some programs before executing that.
